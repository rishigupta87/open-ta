# 📅 Trading Days Implementation (Monday - Friday)

## ✅ **Weekend Detection Added**

### **Backend Enhancements**

#### **1. Enhanced Market Status Engine**
```python
def is_market_open(self, exchange: str) -> bool:
    """Check if market is open including weekday validation"""
    # Monday=0, Tuesday=1, ..., Friday=4, Saturday=5, Sunday=6
    current_weekday = datetime.now(IST).weekday()
    
    # Weekend check (Saturday=5, Sunday=6)
    if current_weekday > 4:
        return False  # Markets closed on weekends
    
    # Check trading hours if it's a weekday
    return hours['start'] <= current_time <= hours['end']
```

#### **2. Detailed Market Status Function**
```python
def get_detailed_market_status(self) -> Dict:
    """Enhanced status with weekday information"""
    return {
        'current_day': 'Saturday',           # Day name
        'is_trading_day': False,             # Weekday vs Weekend
        'status_reason': 'Weekend - Markets closed on Saturday',
        'next_trading_day': 'Monday',        # Next business day
        'days_until_next_trading': 2,        # Days until next trading
        'trading_hours': {
            'MCX': '9:00 AM - 11:30 PM IST (Mon-Fri)',
            'NSE': '9:20 AM - 3:30 PM IST (Mon-Fri)',
            'NFO': '9:20 AM - 3:30 PM IST (Mon-Fri)'
        }
    }
```

### **GraphQL API Updates**

#### **Enhanced Market Status Query**
```graphql
query {
    getMarketStatus {
        success
        message
        activeExchanges
        currentTimeIst
        currentDay              # NEW: "Monday", "Saturday", etc.
        isTradingDay           # NEW: true/false for weekday
        isAnyMarketOpen
        statusReason           # NEW: "Weekend - Markets closed"
        nextTradingDay         # NEW: "Monday", "Tuesday", etc.
        daysUntilNextTrading   # NEW: 0, 1, 2, 3 days
        tradingHours
    }
}
```

### **Frontend Dashboard Updates**

#### **1. Enhanced Market Status Display**
- **Weekday Open**: `🟢 OPEN (Friday)` 
- **Weekday Closed**: `🔴 CLOSED (Wednesday)`
- **Weekend**: `🔴 WEEKEND (Saturday)`
- **Status Reason**: `Weekend - Markets closed on Saturday`
- **Next Trading Day**: `📅 Next trading day: Monday (2 days away)`

#### **2. Smart Signal Section**
**During Weekends:**
```
🗓️ Weekend - Markets are closed on weekends.
📅 Next trading day: Monday (2 days away)

Trading Hours (Monday - Friday):
• MCX: 9:00 AM - 11:30 PM IST
• NSE/NFO: 9:20 AM - 3:30 PM IST
```

**During Weekday (Closed Hours):**
```
🔔 Markets are currently closed. No real-time signals available.

Trading Hours (Monday - Friday):
• MCX: 9:00 AM - 11:30 PM IST  
• NSE/NFO: 9:20 AM - 3:30 PM IST
```

## 📊 **Market Status Logic**

### **Weekend Detection**
```python
current_weekday = datetime.now(IST).weekday()
# Monday=0, Tuesday=1, Wednesday=2, Thursday=3, Friday=4
# Saturday=5, Sunday=6

is_trading_day = current_weekday <= 4  # Monday to Friday only
```

### **Next Trading Day Calculation**
```python
if current_weekday == 4:      # Friday
    next_trading_day = "Monday"
    days_until_next = 3

elif current_weekday == 5:    # Saturday  
    next_trading_day = "Monday"
    days_until_next = 2

elif current_weekday == 6:    # Sunday
    next_trading_day = "Monday" 
    days_until_next = 1

else:                         # Monday to Thursday
    next_trading_day = weekday_names[current_weekday + 1]
    days_until_next = 1
```

## 🧪 **Test Results**

### **Current Test (Saturday)**
```json
{
  "getMarketStatus": {
    "success": true,
    "currentDay": "Saturday",
    "isTradingDay": false,
    "isAnyMarketOpen": false,
    "statusReason": "Weekend - Markets closed on Saturday",
    "nextTradingDay": "Monday",
    "daysUntilNextTrading": 2
  }
}
```

### **Expected Behavior by Day**

| Day | Trading Day | Market Status | Next Trading Day | Days Until |
|-----|-------------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| Monday | ✅ | Open (9:20 AM-11:30 PM) | Tuesday | 1 |
| Tuesday | ✅ | Open (9:20 AM-11:30 PM) | Wednesday | 1 |
| Wednesday | ✅ | Open (9:20 AM-11:30 PM) | Thursday | 1 |
| Thursday | ✅ | Open (9:20 AM-11:30 PM) | Friday | 1 |
| Friday | ✅ | Open (9:20 AM-11:30 PM) | Monday | 3 |
| Saturday | ❌ | Weekend - Closed | Monday | 2 |
| Sunday | ❌ | Weekend - Closed | Monday | 1 |
